# Creator : HERIES Simon

Here you can see one of the projects I created for the university. It's an idea I made on the software StarUML in September and it consists of creating whatever you want. For my part, I decided to create a basic game of a platformer who has a character who dodges enemies and obstacles like spikes or saws, etc. Here are two reasons why I don't continue this project :

1. Licence of StarUML: The duration for this StarUML project was one month and the free try was finished he blocked me from continuing so I gave up after the 1-month trial.

2. Lost interest: I had too many things to do for University and I don't think I could devote most of my time to this StarUML project. I prefer to publish on GitHub because I don't want to delete it on my PC; I spend too much time on this.

## Description of game Robot Jump

The type of game will be a platform game and a "Die and Retry", that is to say that the player must restart the level if he is hit by an enemy or an obstacle. The basic concept is that a character moves and must reach the other end of a level without dying.
The personal game will be called Robot Jump, the appearance of the character will be a robot and will take the elements of the basic concept. The goal of the player will be to complete the level chosen by the player without dying. To do this, he must avoid all types of obstacles and enemies present in the level. The player will be able to move the character in all directions and will have the possibility to eliminate the enemies or avoid them.
The reference class with the most work in it was the 'Character' class.

Note : This README.md is the same as the README.md in Robot_Jump file.
